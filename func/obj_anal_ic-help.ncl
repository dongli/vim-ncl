obj_anal_ic

   Iterative improvement objective analysis.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

        function obj_anal_ic (
                zlon   [*] : numeric,
                zlat   [*] : numeric,
                z          : numeric,
                glon   [*] : numeric,
                glat   [*] : numeric,
                rscan  [*] : numeric,
                option [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   zlon
   zlat

   One-dimensional arrays containing the longitudes and latitudes associated with the z values. They must be the same length
   as the rightmost dimension of z.
   z

   An array, whose rightmost dimension is the same length as zlon and zlat, containing the values associated with the zlon
   and zlat coordinates. Missing values, indicated via z@_FillValue, may be present but will be ignored.
   glon

   A one-dimensional array of length mlon containing the longitude coordinates associated with the returned two-dimensional
   grid.
   glat

   A one-dimensional array of length nlat containing the latitude coordinates associated with the returned two-dimensional
   grid.
   rscan

   A one-dimensional array of length K specifying the successive radii of influence. The maximum size of rscan is 10.
   Typically, rscan contains one-to-four elements. Must be expressed in degrees of latitude and must be monotonically
   decreasing. eg: rscan = (/10, 5, 3/)
   option

   If option=False, this function will operate under default mode. If option=True, then this variable may have associated
   with it the attribute blend_wgt. This specifies how successive new estimates are 'blended'(local smoother) with
   previously derived estimates. These values must be 0.0 < blend_wgt < 1.0. A value of 1.0 means that the current
   interpolated value will be used. Otherwise:
      new_value(n) = blend_wgt(n)*current_estimate + (1-blend_wgt(n))*value(n-1)

   The size of blend_wgt must be the same size as rscan.

Return value

   If z is one dimensional,the return array be nlat x mlon; if multidimensional the return array will be K x nlat x mlon,
   where K represents the leftmost dimensions of z. It will be of type double if z is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   This performs an iterative improvement type objective analysis using an input triplet set ( zlon, zlat, z). For each
   gridpoint, multiple passes of descending radii of influence are used to obtain better estimates.

   Note_1: This built-in function replaces a previous function of the same name that was located in contributed.ncl
   [v5.1.0]. the built-in function is much faster. Unfortunately, it does not support the guess, zonal, count and setmsg
   optional arguments.

   Note_2: It is possible that some returned grid points could be _FillValue. If this is not desired, increase the radii of
   influence.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume zlon, zlat and zVal are one-dimensional (1D) arrays; let lon and lat be 1D arrays specifying grid locations. Then:
   rscan = (/10, 5, 2/)
   grid = obj_anal_ic(zlon,zlat,zVal, lon,lat, rscan, False)

   will use default behavior and return a 2D array of size nlat x mlon.

   Example 2

   Let zVal be a two-dimensional array of size (T,KPTS). Let lon and lat be 1D arrays of lengths N and M specifying grid
   locations. Then:
   grid = obj_anal_ic(xlon,ylat,zVal, lon,lat, False)        ; grid(T,N,M)

   will use default behavior and return a 3D array of size T x nlat x mlon.

   Example 3

   opt  = True
   opt@blend_wgt = (/1.0, 0.5, 0.25/)
   grid = obj_anal_ic(xlon,ylat,zVal, lon,lat, opt)
