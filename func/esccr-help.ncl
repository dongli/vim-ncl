esccr

   Computes sample cross-correlations.

Prototype

        function esccr (
                x         : numeric,
                y         : numeric,
                mxlag [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   x

   An array of any numeric type or size. The rightmost dimension is usually time.
   y

   An array of any numeric type or size. The rightmost dimension is usually time. The size of the rightmost dimension must
   be the same as x.
   mxlag

   A scalar integer. It is recommended that 0 <= mxlag <= N/4. This is because the correlation algorithm(s) use N rather
   than (N-k) values in the denominator (Chatfield Chapter 4).

Description

   Computes sample cross-correlations using the equations found in Chatfield [The Analysis of Time Series, 1982, Chapman and
   Hall]. Missing values are allowed.

   Currently, to calculate positive and negative lags, one must invoke this function twice. (See example 3 below.)

   Algorithm: Here, y(t) and y(t+k) refer to the rightmost dimension. k runs from 0 to mxlag.
     c(k) = SUM [(x(t)-xAve)*(y(t+k)-yAve)}]/(xStd*yStd)

   The dimension sizes(s) of c are a function of the dimension sizes of the x and y arrays. The following illustrates
   dimensioning:

        x(N), y(N)          c(mxlag+1)
        x(N), y(K,M,N)      c(K,M,mxlag+1)
      x(I,N), y(K,M,N)      c(I,K,M,mxlag+1)
    x(J,I,N), y(L,K,M,N)    c(J,I,L,K,M,mxlag+1)

   Special case when dimensions of all x and y are identical:
    x(J,I,N), y(J,I,N)      c(J,I,mxlag+1)

   When calculating lag cross-correlations, Chatfield (pp. 60-62, p. 173) recommends using the entire series (i.e. all
   non-missing values) to estimate mean and standard deviation rather than (N-k) values. The reason is better mean-square
   error properties.

   There are trade-offs to be made. For example, it is possible that correlation coefficients calculated using qAve and qStd
   based on the entire series can lead to correlation coefficients that are > 1. or < -1. This is because the subset (N-k)
   points might be a series with slightly different statistical characteristics.

   Thus, the qAve, sAve, qStd, sStd, qVar estimates are calculated using the entire series. In the case of, say, esccr, the
   qAve, qStd could be based upon L non-missing values while the sAve, sStd could be based upon M non-missing values. It is
   felt that this approach yields the best statistical estimates of these quantities.

   If the user has two one-dimensional series with missing values where the lag cross-correlation at zero lag is desired and
   the user wishes the lag-0 correlations to be calculated based upon indices when q and s are both present, then use the
   following approach:
    good = ind(.not.ismissing(q) .and. .not.ismissing(s))
    esccr(q(good),s(good),0))

   This only works at lag zero.

   The correlation coefficient (r) for n pairs of independent observations can be tested against the null hypothesis (ie.:
   no correlation) using the statistic
    r*sqrt[ (n-2)/(1-r^2) ]

   This statistic has a Student t distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom.

Examples

   Example 1:

   The following will calculate the cross-correlation for a two one-dimensional arrays x(N) and y(N) at 11 lags (0->10). The
   result is a one-dimensional array of length 11.
        acr = esccr(x,y,10)   ; acr(0:10)

   Example 2:

   The following will calculate the cross-correlation for two three-dimensional arrays x(lat,lon,time) and y(time,lat,lon)
   at mxlag + 1 lags (0->mxlag).
     mxlag = 10
     acr   = esccr(x,y(lat|:,lon|:,time|:),mxlag) ; acr(nlat,nlon,mxlag+1)

   Example 3:

   To calculate both positive and negative lags, it is necessary to do the calculation twice.
     mxlag    = 9
     x_Lead_y = esccr(x,y,mxlag)
     y_Lead_x = esccr(y,x,mxlag)    ; switch the order of the series

     ccr = new ( 2*mxlag+1, float)
     ccr(0:mxlag-1) = y_Lead_x(1:mxlag:-1)  ; "negative lag", -1 reverses order
     ccr(mxlag:)    = x_Lead_y(0:mxlag)     ; "positive lag"

   Remember that NCL is C based and does not allow negative subscripts like Fortran does (in Fortran, ccr(-mxlag:mxlag)).
   Thus in the above example ccr(0:mxlag-1) corresponds to lags -9,-8,...,-2,-1 and ccr(mxlag:2*mxlag) corresponds to lags
   0,1,2,...,8,9.
