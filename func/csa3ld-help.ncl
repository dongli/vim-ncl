csa3ld

   Calculates an approximating cubic spline for three-dimensional input data.

Prototype

        function csa3ld (
                xi    [*] : double,
                yi    [*] : double,
                zi    [*] : double,
                ui        : double,
                knots [3] : integer,
                xo    [*] : double,
                yo    [*] : double,
                zo    [*] : double
        )

        return_val  :  double

Arguments

   xi

   A 1-dimensional array of length nxi containing the X coordinates of the input data points.
   yi

   A 1-dimensional array of length nxi containing the Y coordinates of the input data points.
   zi

   A 1-dimensional array of length nxi containing the Z coordinates of the input data points.
   ui

   An array of any dimensionality (last dimension must be nxi) containing the functional values at the input data
   coordinates given by xi, yi, and zi. That is, ui(...,k) is the input function value at (xi(k),yi(k),zi(k)) for k = 0 to
   nxi-1.
   knots

   The number of knots to be used in constructing the approximating surface. knots(0), knots(1), and knots(2) must all be at
   least 4. The larger the value for knots, the closer the approximated surface will come to passing through the input
   function values.
   xo

   A one-dimensional array of length nxo containing the X coordinates of a list of points where functional values are
   desired. xo can be a single point.
   yo

   A one-dimensional array of the same length as xo containing the Y coordinates of a list of points where functional values
   are desired. yo can be a single point.
   zo

   A one-dimensional array of the same length as xo containing the Z coordinates of a list of points where functional values
   are desired. zo can be a single point.

Return value

   An array containing the calculated functional values. The array will be the same size as ui, except that the last
   dimension will be nxo. If uo is the returned value, then uo(...,i) contains the functional value at coordinate
   (xo(i),yo(i),zo(i)) for i=0,nxo-1.

Description

   This function is part of the Csagrid package - a software package that implements a cubic spline approximation algorithm
   to fit a function to input data. The input for the approximation is a set of randomly-spaced data, which may be
   one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional. The general documentation for Csagrid contains several complete
   examples.

   The following three three-dimensional functions all do the same thing, differing only in the type of the input and output
   arrays: csa3 (generic input/output); csa3s (single input/output); csa3d (double input/output).

   If you want to weight the input data values, calculate derivatives, or handle sparse data areas specially, you should
   instead use one of these "expanded" functions (note the "x" following the "3" in the name): csa3x (generic input/output);
   csa3xs (single input/output); csa3xd (double input/output).

   If you want to compute function values at a specified list of coordinate positions, rather than at coordinate positions
   forming a grid, you should use one of these six "list form" functions (note the "l" following the "3" in the name):
   csa3l; csa3ls; csa3ld; csa3lx; csa3lxs; csa3lxd.
